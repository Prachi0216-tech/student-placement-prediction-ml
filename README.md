# Student Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
To predict whether a student will get placed based on academic performance
and other factors using machine learning.

## Dataset
Campus Recruitment Dataset containing student academic details and placement status.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Approach
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing
- Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Logistic Regression classification model
- Evaluated model using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## Result
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 88%.

## Conclusion
The model can effectively predict student placement outcomes and highlights
key academic factors influencing employability.
